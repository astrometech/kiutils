Known issues
============

- **Footprint:** Whitespaces in the items section do sometimes not correspond
  correctly to those generated by KiCad. This will be picked up by an SCM as a
  change even though no changes were initially made. This seems to be a bug in
  KiCad itself, as it sometimes sets the whitespaces before those tokens
  correctly and sometimes not.

- **Schematic:** Sometimes KiCad inserts blank lines between wires, bus entries
  and polylines which are not picked up by the parser. Same problem as above
  with SCMs.

- **Backwards compatibility:** KiCad <6 file formats can be parsed, but will
  be converted to KiCad 6 style S-Expression upon saving. It was observed that
  e.g. footprints of an older version will experience conversion errors in some
  features that KiCad 6 now handles differently (see `fp_arc` as an example).
  It is in the user's hands to decide on how to deal with this, but support
  for converting correctly to KiCad 6 formats may be added in the future.
  Please create an issue with a snippet of what you are trying to parse when
  stumbling upon such a situation.

- **Design rules:** Support for custom design rules was implemented without a
  proper documentation. Thus it might be subject to bugs or changes. It
  furthermore may not exactly place the items associated with a custom design
  rule (constraints, layers, etc) in the same order as the user once put them
  when parsing and writing back `.kicad_dru` files
